# ParkingLotManagementSystem
This project called Parking Lot Managemente System is a program where the core concepts of Java are being implemented, specially focusing on the OOP core concepts: polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation. The development of the program is based on a simple logical way (not too much specialized features) but I'll inlcude some built-in Java functions such as list, some validation data tools, etc.

The main functions of the code are very simple: 
- Park a Vehicle (Car, Truck, Motorcycle).
- UnPark Vehicle as soon as it leaves.
- Generate Ticked Id for the vehicle that is parking.

Some other functionalities are: 
- Get Number of Open Slots is also a funcionality that helps us to know how many available spaces we have for the vehicles.
- Display Open Slots is another more detailed list of the slots we have available for each type of vehicle.
- Display Occupied Slots is a useful function to know those slots that are already busy.
